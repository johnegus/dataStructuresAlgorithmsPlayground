# 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
# Easy

# Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

# Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

# Input: head = [1,0,1]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def getDecimalValue(self, head):
        answer = 0
        while head:
            answer = 2*answer + head.val
            head = head.next
        return answer
