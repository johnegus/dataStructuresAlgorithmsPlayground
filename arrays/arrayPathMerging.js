// Array Path Merging
// Thinking back through a question scenario I need to perfect involving path compression, merging, and Disjoint Sets/Graphs.

// Answer here is likely not very optimal but provides a solution.

// Challenge: calculate the number of disjoint graphs. Represent each disjoint graph with exactly one array.

// Example: Given [[1,2,4],[1,7]] => [[1,2,4,7]].
